// Execption handling is a process to handle errors in a manageable and predictable manner.
// It uses try/catch statement to catch an error/exception arising in the try block and let the programmer decide on how to
// take care of the error by using the catch block in a way that our application/program does not fail/crash.

// Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises, 
// and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
