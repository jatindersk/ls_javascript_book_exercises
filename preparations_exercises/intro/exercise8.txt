let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
foo.length;  // returns 3
foo[3];      // will this result in an error?

Ans(Incorrect):
Yes, it will result in an error as element with index number 3 doesn't exist as in an array elements are indexed from zero (0).

Solution
No, there won't be an error. When you use an index value that has no corresponding element, JavaScript returns undefined.
